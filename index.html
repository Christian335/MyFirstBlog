    <p>There's a new blog around these parts.<br />
        Blogging about all the nerd noir goodies you noir nerds have been chitting and chatting about. <br />
        I'm typing stuff while listening to a Podcast about Scream 2.<br />
        Released in 1997, this film follows the story of Sidney Prescott from the first film and her friends in
        college.<br />
        This film is now a fan favorite in the franchise for the LGBTQ community.<br />
        I'm pretty sure I spelled some things wrong.<br />
        They just mentioned Buffy and <em>SHOOT DANG</em> I love that show.<br />
        I feel like only two of you guys even know what Buffy the Vampire Slayer is in this piece.<br />
        Now that I think about it, you guys don't really like the nerdy stuff I'm into.<br />
        Well Warren does,<em> damn I'm a sad human being</em>.<br />
        I bet you're all laughing now. <br />
        Yeah, it's cool. It was funny.<br />
        Cindy if you're reading this I want you to picture me saying in that silly voice I do...<br />
        Listen to these <strong>TRACKS!</strong> <br />
        Only I'm done typing, I barely know what I'm doing.<br />
        Real quick, just saw this big dude taking out his trash and thought about James whooping his ass.<br />
        <em>Later Homies!</em></p>
